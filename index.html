				<h4>About StoryWeaver</h4>
				<p>Welcome to StoryWeaver from Pratham Books, a digital repository of high-quality multilingual stories for children.</p>

				<p>Pratham Books is a not-for-profit children’s publisher, and StoryWeaver is its open, collaborative platform that enables creators (authors, illustrators, educators, and the like), and readers (parents, teachers, students, and above all, children) to interact with one another. Users can read, create, translate, download, and share digital storybooks for free - vastly improving access to quality reading content for children, in over 160 languages.</p>

				<h4>Open licensing</h4>
				<p>All storybooks are open licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> licence, and can be used and adapted freely - with appropriate attribution - to suit a user’s needs. To amplify our reach, we are open sourcing the code as well, so that developers across the world can use it as is, or adapt it to meet their needs.</p>

				<p>StoryWeaver is built on Rails, a web application framework with ReactJS as its front-end technology. The third-party libraries we use are also open-source. We have released our most active codebase under the OSI-approved <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a> because its the most liberal. We believe this will enable wide adoption of code base for various purposes even among commercial enterprises.</p>

				<p>All the code that we release is mature. The platform continues to be actively developed by Pratham Books and new code will be released as soon as it passes internal QA processes.</p>

				<h4>Code</h4>
				<p>All our code is on GitHub where anyone can view and participate in the further development of StoryWeaver - make sure you take a look at our <a href="./code-of-conduct">participation guidelines</a>. Contributions of any kind, including bug reports, patches, suggestions, and feature requests, are welcome.</p>

				<h4>Audiences</h4>
				<p>There are multiple anticipated beneficiaries of the open source StoryWeaver code base. For Educational organizations it is an excellent starting point to build multilingual collaborative digital books/materials  for children. It can be used for building any platform that allows users to read, create, translate, download, and share visual and text content. For developers and freelancers, there are several standalone components and algorithms like recommendation engine, image processing and cropping and others which can be used in other projects.  The potential of our code is endless and we are excited to see what you will build with this. You may even wish to recommend ideas and features to improve the platform.
				</p>

				<p>If you'd like to adopt StoryWeaver as a platform for your needs, our developer team would love to connect. Drop us an email at <a href="mailto:swopensource.support@prathambooks.org">swopensource.support@prathambooks.org</a></p>
