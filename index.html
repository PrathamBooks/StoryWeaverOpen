        <h4>About StoryWeaver</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to Pratham Books’ SW, a digital platform of open storybooks for children in multiple languages. PB is a non profit children’s book publisher with a mission to see ‘a book in every child’s hand’. As part of its mission to make books available and accessible to all children, it created SW which not only provides access to thousands of high quality storybooks for children to build their reading skills but also has provides simple tools that enable users to translate or version the books to their local contexts. This has led to a huge amplification of books and there are over 13,000 books available in 183 languages and users across the globe are using and contributing to building this world class open library for children. 
       </p>

        <h4>Open licensing</h4>
        <p>
        All storybooks are <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">open-licensed</a>, and can be used and adapted freely  - with appropriate attribution - to suit a user’s needs. To amplify our reach, we are open sourcing the code as well, so that developers across the world can use it as is, or adapt it to meet their needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          StoryWeaver is built on Rails, a web application framework with ReactJS as its front-end technology. The third-party libraries we use are also open source. We have released our most active codebase under the OSI-approved <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>, one of the most liberal licenses. the We believe this will enable the wider adoption of this codebase for various purposes, including commercial ones.
          </p>

        <p>
          All the code that we release is mature. The platform continues to be
          actively developed by Pratham Books and new code will be released as
          soon as it passes internal QA processes.
        </p>

        <h4>Code</h4>
        <p>
          All our code is on GitHub where anyone can view and participate in the
          further development of StoryWeaver - make sure you take a look at our
          <a href="./code-of-conduct">participation guidelines</a>.
          Contributions of any kind, including bug reports, patches,
          suggestions, and feature requests, are welcome.
        </p>

        <h4>Audiences</h4>
        <p>
          Having seen the rapid adoption and extensive usage of StoryWeaver in India, as well as globally, we believe that many more can benefit from our platform. Educators have access to an extremely  large repository of reading material. Moreover, they can customise this material for their classrooms by translating the books using the tools on the platform or creating new books using the vast open image library. Parents can co-create stories with their children. Readers, of all levels, can discover storybooks of their choice and language.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Developers can play a massive role in helping us in our ambition of making reading accessible for all.</strong> You may contribute to the standalone components and algorithms - the recommendation engine, image processing tools, cropping and formatting features, and more. The potential of our code is endless and we are excited to see what you will build with this.You may even wish to recommend ideas and features to improve the platform.
