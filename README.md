Welcome to StoryWeaver from Pratham Books! Designed to provide children with reading resources, StoryWeaver is a digital gateway to thousands of richly illustrated, open-licensed children's stories in mother tongue languages. There's more to StoryWeaver than just reading. It is also a first-of-its-kind platform that provides easy-to-use tools to create, adapt, and translate new stories for children. It's the ideal place for parents, educators, writers, translators, and illustrators to come together to weave new stories for children and help to create a pathway to nurture the next generation of readers!
