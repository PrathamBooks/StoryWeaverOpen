# StoryWeaver Open-source Initiative

[![Start](https://storyweaver.org.in/assets/media/storyweaver-logo.e8ce4cf1.svg)](https://storyweaver.org.in/)

Welcome to StoryWeaver from Pratham Books, a digital repository of multilingual stories for children. StoryWeaver is attempting to address the scarcity of books for children by creating an open and collaborative framework where the creators and consumers of childrenâ€™s content could interact with one another. Users can read, create, translate, download, and share stories for free.  Now, every child can have access to an endless stream of stories in her mother tongue.

This powerful platform is available open-source in the following repositories.
